## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this project** to your local machine

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd jam_data_test
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or if you're using Anaconda/Miniconda:
   ```bash
   conda install streamlit pandas matplotlib requests numpy
   ```

### Running the Application

Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run weather_app.py
```

The application will automatically open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 📱 How to Use

### Main Dashboard
- The dashboard loads automatically with 30 days of historical data and a 7-day forecast
- View current temperature, forecast highs/lows, and key statistics at the top
- Scroll down to see the interactive chart and detailed forecast tables

### Sidebar Controls
1. **Historical Period**: Select how many days of past data to display (7, 14, 30, or 60 days)
2. **Show Confidence Interval**: Toggle the shaded uncertainty band around forecasts
3. **Refresh Data**: Click to fetch the latest weather data (clears cache)

### Understanding the Visualization
- **Blue Line**: Historical actual temperatures (measured data)
- **Red Line**: Forecast temperatures (predicted data)
- **Shaded Red Area**: 95% confidence interval (if enabled)
  - Near-term forecasts: ±2°F uncertainty
  - 7-day forecasts: ±6°F uncertainty
- **Vertical Dashed Line**: Marks where history ends and forecast begins
- **Statistics Box**: Summary of temperature ranges

### Data Tables
- **Daily Summary Table**: Shows min, max, and average temperatures for each day
- **Next 24 Hours Table**: Hourly breakdown of temperature predictions

## 📊 Data Sources

This application uses the **Open-Meteo API** which provides:

- **Historical Data**: [Archive API](https://archive-api.open-meteo.com/)
  - Actual measured temperatures from weather stations
  - Available for past dates with hourly resolution

- **Forecast Data**: [Forecast API](https://open-meteo.com/)
  - 7-day hourly temperature predictions
  - Updated regularly throughout the day

**Location**: Washington DC (38.9072°N, 77.0369°W)

**Note**: Data is cached for 30 minutes to reduce API calls and improve performance. Click "Refresh Data" to force a fresh fetch.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Requests**: HTTP library for API calls
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations

### Performance Optimizations
- `@st.cache_data` decorator with 30-minute TTL (time-to-live)
- Efficient data fetching with consolidated API calls
- Optimized rendering with Streamlit's native components

### Confidence Interval Methodology
The 95% confidence interval is calculated using a realistic uncertainty model:
- **Base uncertainty**: ±2°F for near-term forecasts
- **Maximum uncertainty**: ±6°F for 7-day forecasts
- **Linear increase**: Uncertainty grows linearly with forecast horizon
- This reflects how forecast accuracy decreases over time

## 💡 Use Cases

- **Personal Weather Planning**: Check detailed forecasts before planning outdoor activities
- **Data Analysis**: Study temperature trends and patterns in Washington DC
- **Educational**: Learn about forecast uncertainty and confidence intervals
- **Professional Demos**: Showcase data visualization and web app development skills
- **Research**: Access historical weather data for analysis

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a demonstration project. Feel free to fork and modify for your own use!

### Potential Enhancements
- Add more locations beyond Washington DC
- Include additional weather parameters (humidity, precipitation, wind speed)
- Add weather alerts and warnings
- Export data to CSV/Excel from the web interface
- Add comparison between different time periods
- Include weather pattern analysis and trends

## 📄 License

This project uses the Open-Meteo API which is free for non-commercial use.

## 🙋 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If you see an error about port 8501 being in use:
```bash
streamlit run weather_app.py --server.port 8502
```

### Import Errors
Make sure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

### API Connection Issues
- Check your internet connection
- The Open-Meteo API might be temporarily unavailable
- Try clicking "Refresh Data" after a few moments

### Slow Performance
- The first load might take a few seconds to fetch data
- Subsequent loads use cached data for faster performance
- Clear cache using the "Refresh Data" button if needed
